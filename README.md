# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning models. The dataset used is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not.

## Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques to predict binary outcomes (survival or not). The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training multiple machine learning models to evaluate their performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It contains the following features:

- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Fare**: Ticket fare
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

The target variable is **Survived**, which indicates whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).

## Models Used

The following machine learning models were used in this project:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

## Results

The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy among the models.
